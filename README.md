Abstract: *We develop a conditional factor model for the term structure of treasury bonds, which unifies
non-parametric curve estimation with cross-sectional asset pricing. Our factors correspond to
the optimal non-parametric basis functions spanning the discount curve. They are investable
portfolios estimated with cross-sectional ridge regressions and derived from economic first principles. Empirically, we show that four factors explain the discount bond excess return curve
and term structure premium. Cash flows are covariances, as cash flows of coupon bonds fully
explain the factor exposure. The term structure premium depends on the market complexity
measured by the time-varying importance of higher order factors.*
